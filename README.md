# Market Flow
Going to the supermarket is non-negotiable, but it's a stressful process—you have to make the shopping list, then go to the store and search for what you need to bring home. Market Flow was created to help you enjoy the experience of grocery shopping.

__1.__ You add the item you need to buy

__2.__ Select the category it belongs to

__3.__ Receive an ordered list based on your supermarket's layout.

__4.__ Then, you just copy it to a notepad or print it, and you don’t have to worry about forgetting anything.
